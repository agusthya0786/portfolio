### Julius-Maximilians-University Wurzburg
The [M.Sc. program Quantum Engineering](https://www.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/international/quantum-engineering/) is a two-year program with the first year focusing on a lecture-, seminar- and lab-course program to deepen and widen the knowledge of students based on their experience from B.Sc.- level studies. In the second year, students are working on a topical project in quantum engineering integrated in a faculty research team under the supervision of a professor or senior scientist, leading to a master thesis. The program is compatible with the Bologna process of the European Higher Education Area. The students will take courses in experimental and theoretical physics, an advanced seminar and an advanced lab course. There is a wide selection of elective courses including many courses on current research topics. These are given by active researchers in the respective fields to help students prepare for their own  research. In this program students are advised to contact potential supervisors of their master thesis early for advice on which lectures are best suited for preparing them for their thesis topic of choice.
<br>Tuition is NA.

Duration: 4 semesters (2.0 years)

### Ulm University
The aim of [MSc Quantum Enginnering](https://www.uni-ulm.de/nawi/international-masters-degree-programmes/ps/m-sc-quantum-engineering-overview) programme is to provide a comprehensive education and hands-on research in quantum engineering and relative miniaturization methods, prepare students to design, realize and test quantum systems for quantum enabled sensing, computing and navigation and train the next generation of scientists in the interdisciplinary field of quantum technologies.
Students will complete courses from an adaptation area at the beginning of the programme, the scope and content of which may depend on whether admission to the Master's programme is based on a Bachelor in Physics or in Engineering. The adaptation area is designed to provide students from diverse backgrounds with the necessary skills to successfully complete the master's degree. In addition to core interdisciplinary lectures in quantum engineering, students may choose specialisation courses from the vast offer of quantum physics and engineering modules available at our university. 
During the second year, students have the opportunity to carry out research at the academic level by completing an independent research project, or can choose to do an internship in an external institute or industry. Alternatively, students may apply for an exchange scholarship and spend the third semester abroad at a partner university. By completing the 6-months long Master's Thesis, students will conclude the strongly research-oriented degree programme.
<br>Tuition is set at 1500 Euro each semester - only non-EU students, with administrative fees of ca. 180 Euro each semester.

Duration: 4 semesters (2 years)
