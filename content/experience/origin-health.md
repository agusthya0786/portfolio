- The project focused mainly on creating a platform for a comprehensive and curated collection of resources aiming to help understand Quantum Computing.
- I was allotted to one respective group under a mentor to work on major computational issues faced during Quantum Computation, like `Quantum Error Correction`.
-   During the course of my internship, I devised a Quantum Error Detection model based on surface error code, it enhanced my skills and knowledge in this particular field.
- QMap, the outcome of a project at QWorld, is a comprehensive and curated collection of resources aiming to help you in exploring and understanding various aspects of Quantum Technology.
