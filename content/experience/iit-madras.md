## Description
**Guide:** [V.Raghavendra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghavendra-v-b011272a/?originalSubdomain=in)

- Working on an ongoing project as a part of my work as a junior researcher at Qkrishi, Gurgaon, India.
- The objective is to develop a novel optimized quantum algorithm using several methods, like the phase estimation technique to solve the `traveling salesman problem and vehicle routing problem` and benchmark the respective routing algorithm on various available QPUs by testing on several optimization algorithms to observe and compare the best optimal minimal cost.
